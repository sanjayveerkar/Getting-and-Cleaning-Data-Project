# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project

The code takes for granted all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. 

The output of the 5th step is called tidy.txt.

I used R-Studio to run this code and the entire project. As long as you have the source data copied into your working directory the code would run.
